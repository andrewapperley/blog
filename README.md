# Blog
This repo will house my Portfolio Website's blog entries.

Each entry will be in a new folder and contain:

* A set of images (optional)
* A set of videos (maybe add this feature in the future)
* A markdown file

At the root of the repo will be a JSON file. This will list all of the blog entries and define the following:

* Main Title
* Path
* Snippet
* Date
